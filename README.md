<h1 align='center'> Document Layout Analysis </h1>

This repository contains a project which consists in the deliverable for the _Project Work in Machine Learning for Computer Vision_ exam of the [Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, University of Bologna](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/artificial-intelligence).

## About
Document Layout Analysis is one of the main tasks of Document AI, a challenging research branch that refers to various techniques for accurately analyzing, organizing and parsing unstructured digital documents. The ability to efficiently and accurately gain insights about documents that are only human-readable (and not machine-readable) is highly requested in the business domain, as it could automate time-demanding and tedious tasks that are still assigned to humans, such as information retrieval from a big pile of resumes.

## Prerequisites
This project was developed in `Python3` and `pytorch`. Run the following command to install the prerequisites:

```bash
# Windows & Linux
pip install --no-cache -r ./requirements.txt
```

Otherwise, you can build a ready-to-go virtual environment by running the following script from the project's folder:

```bash
# Linux
> ./scripts/build-venv.sh

# Windows
> .\scripts\build-venv.bat
```

### Download dataset
The dataset used for this project is DocLayNet, which can be downloaded from [here](https://developer.ibm.com/data/doclaynet/).
